IPOP stands for IP-over-P2P. IPOP-tincan refers to the new architecture
which leverages the
[Google libjingle library](https://developers.google.com/talk/libjingle/)
to create P2P connection with peers behind NATs. It also uses the XMPP 
protocol to identify and bootstrap encrypted P2P tunnels with social peers.

# Support Operating Systems
We currently primarily support Linux, where we do the majority of our testing.
But we also have been experimenting with Android, OpenWRT, Raspberry Pi
and Windows. Feel free to test them out. You can find download links by
going to the *Running the code* section on the sidebar.

# Contact
