- On-demand / Persistent Connection

GroupVPN has two modes on establishing the P2P connection. One create P2P connection once it starts to run, the other starts to establish connection when there appears a packet that is destined to a node without P2P connection yet. We call former as persistent connection and latter as on-demand connection. 


On-demand connection is useful for reducing connection overhead which is one drawlback of P2P connection.
