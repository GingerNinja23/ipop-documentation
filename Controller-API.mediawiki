IPOP-Tincan provides a JSON-RPC API over UDP which enables developers
to extend the functionality of the P2PVPN. This page explain the
basic functions available over this API.

== register_svc ==
This function is designed to allow IPOP-Tincan to register to a
backend service which will be used to discover social peers and
bootstrap encrypted P2P connections. Since we currently only support
XMPP service, this is basically the XMPP username and password.

{| class="wikitable"
!Parameter
!Type
!Description
|-
|username
|string
|the username used to login to the XMPP service (e.g. username@gmail.com)
|-
|password
|string
|the password used to login to the XMPP service
|}

== create_link ==

|-
|overlay_id
|integer
|IPOP-Tincan will support multiple overlays in the future (e.g. XMPP, Gnunet)
so we need an ID for each overlay. Currently, we only support two hardcoded
IDs (0 for controller, 1 for XMPP service). For now, always set this to 1.
|-
|uid
|string
|every user has a unique identifier that is determined by the controller. This
identifier has to be a 40-byte long hexadecimal.
|-
|fpr
|string
|this is the X509 fingerprint (hash of X509 certificate) of the user. This is
obtained from the `get_state` api call described below. IPOP-Tincan generates
an X.509 certificate everytime it runs which resides in main memory.
|-
|stun
|string
|this parameter specifies the TURN server that will be used for this connection
(e.g. stun.google.com:19302). You can provide an empty string for this
parameter but the connection will only succeed if one of the two peers are
not behind a NAT.
|-
|turn
|string
|this parameter specifies the TURN server that will be used for this connection
(e.g. ip-of-turn-server:port). This can be an empty string and is only required
if both peers are behind symmetric NATs.
|-
|turn_user
|string
|the username for accessing the TURN server, can be empty string.
|-
|turn_pass
|string
|the password for accessing the TURN server, can be empty string.
|-
|cas
|string
|a specifially formatted string that contain a list of IP addresses and
connection credentials necessary for boostrapping an ICE connection.
[See ICE RFC](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245) for more information.
|-
|sec
|boolean
|this parameter specifies whether or not the connection should be encrypted.
